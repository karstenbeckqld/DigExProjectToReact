                    <p>Gin is a great liquor to explore. Its botanicals give it a characteristic that no other liquor has;
                       one brand can have a completely different profile from another, and it is surprisingly versatile when
                       it comes to flavor profiles. Gin is also the foundation for some of the best drinks ever made,
                       including the iconic martini.</p>

                    <p>Tequila cocktails are diverse and a lot of fun to explore. You can mix up the original margarita
                       or enjoy it in a variety of flavors, from strawberry to tamarind. The beauty of tequila is that
                       its agave flavor brings an earthy, semi-sweet element to drinks. It's a flavor you won't find in
                       any other distilled spirit, and it's fascinating to discover how that reacts with a variety of
                       mixers. </p>
